Task #1 : Create a simple profile webpage about yourself using HTML and basic CSS. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The webpage consists of basic information about me, my education, recent activities and projects.  
Since I have limited CSS knowledge, I only put boxes and links and nothing very interesting.  
The color scheme might seem a little off,but there weren't many elements so I was unable to add different colors.
